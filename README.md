# Power 4

This project is the hanged man's game. 

I did it in 2018, during my 2nd year of university license. This is a personnal project, and is developed in Python3. This project is finished.

## Rules
One player choose a word to guess. The other player must guess the word, in 12 chances.

## To begin
Do the command :  `$ git clone https://github.com/debroucker/the_hanged.git` to recover this repository.

## Prerequisite
You need to have Python3.
So, if you haven't it, do the command : `$ sudo apt-get install python3`

## Start-up
To launch the game, do the command : `$ python3 src/pendu_turtle.py` in the main directory, and enjoy.
